        Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a 
        cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head,
        and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are 
        classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the 
        sister group to the rays. However, the term "shark" has also been used 
        for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the 
        Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus, as well as other
         Chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans.
